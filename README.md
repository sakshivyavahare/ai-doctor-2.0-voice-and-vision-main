🧠 AI Doctor 2.0: Voice and Vision Medical Assistant

This project is a multimodal AI-powered virtual medical assistant that leverages voice input, computer vision, and large language models to deliver intelligent, real-time healthcare support. Designed for modern telemedicine and personal health monitoring applications, it allows users to interact via natural speech and image uploads for symptom analysis and diagnosis suggestions.

🔍 Features:

🎙️ Voice-to-Text Interface using Whisper/Groq:
Converts user speech to text in real-time for hands-free interaction.

🗣️ AI-Powered Medical Q&A:
Uses LLMs (like GPT/Groq) to understand symptoms and suggest diagnoses or advice.

🩻 Medical Image Analysis:
Supports input of medical images (e.g., X-rays, skin lesions) for AI-based visual analysis using models like BioViL, CLIP, or custom CNNs.

🔊 Text-to-Speech Output:
Converts medical advice back into spoken form using ElevenLabs or gTTS.

🌐 Gradio UI:
Intuitive, user-friendly web interface for interacting with the assistant.
